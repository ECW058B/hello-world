class assignment
Hello, I am Ethan Wilson. I am pursuing my 3rd associates degree in cyber security in hopoes to create a better financial life for myself and future family. I enjoy playing drums and writing music, watching some sports, PC and Tabletop gaming with my friends and going to the gym. I have a farm with animals where I grow grass hay and enjoy a life of somewhat solitude with my girlfriend.
